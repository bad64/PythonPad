Here's the main config files I've written for the couple of MCUs I tested !

If you used the wrong file, or did some dodgy modifications, it's no big deal, the firmware will fail to initialize and... that's it. It'll just sit there, waiting for you to write a valid config file to the drive. Don't panic, it's gonna be okay !
